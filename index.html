            I’m the founder at <a href="http://makerbased.com" target="_blank"> Maker Based Education </a> where we’re working to help schools bridge the gap               between what students
            should be and are learning.  I have a dream that one day every student will have the chance to learn skills (both hard and soft) that will
            equip them to be powerful in the real world.

            I’m also the Online Director at <a href="http://miles2give.org/" target="_blank">Miles 2 Give </a>where we run across and around countries (10,000+ miles around the
            US this year) to help raise money for Sarcoma cancer research.
